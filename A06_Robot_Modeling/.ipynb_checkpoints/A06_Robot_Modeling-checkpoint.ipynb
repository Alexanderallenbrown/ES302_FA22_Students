    "# Robot Modeling: Due 10/7/2022\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"robot brain\" you built for A04 was not very sophisticated, only reacting to the environment and making decisions based on a simple \"desire\" to maintain a particular orientation and/or distance with respect to another robot. Using [Dennett's Creatures](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Science:_An_Introduction/Kinds_of_Intelligences) as a guide, we could classify your A04 robot's intelligence as \"Darwinian,\" because the robot acts only based on simple rules and desires, and cannot learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many modern robots have some capacity to learn. We may or may not get to talk about learning in robots in ES302, but suffice it to say that robots that learn *might* be classified as \"Skinnerian Creatures\" in Dennett's taxonomy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern mobile and manipulator robots also use complex optimization algorithms to *plan* motion intelligently. This means that the robots \"try\" options for motion and/or action *before they act*. Autonomous vehicles sometimes use a paradigm called [Model Predictive Control](https://sites.lafayette.edu/brownaa/files/2021/01/FontBrown2020_Deercollisions_PREPRINT.pdf) to predict the outcome of a series of inputs, evaluate that outcome, and \"tune\" behavioral patterns before acting. This gives many modern robots some characteristics of \"Popperian Creatures\" in Dennett's taxonomy. Quoting [Cognitive Science: An Introduction](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Science:_An_Introduction), we can examine the definition of a Popperian Creature:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Popperian creatures have all the skills of Skinnerian creatures, but can also consider hypothetical situations and make decisions based on the outcome in their imagination. For example, you might imagine that hot sauce on ice cream would taste bad, so you choose not to eat it. You learned, in this case, from a simulation in your imagination, rather than directly from experience with the environment. This class is named after Karl Popper, a philosopher of science.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key feature that enables the development of Popperian behavior in a robot is the *internal model*. A robot that has a way to dynamically predict the results of its actions (and those of other agents around it) has the *infrastructure* required to predict the outcomes of future behavior. In doing so, the robot can evaluate these actions and optimize them against an objective function to choose \"the best\" actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will develop a physics-based, dynamic model of the Romi's **angular velocity** and **forward velocity** so that we can give the Romi the ability to predict where it will be given a time history of its motor voltages."

    "\n",
    "1. Beginning with the physics-based model we developed together in class relating Romi motor voltage to forward motion, and using the data you collected for a real Romi in A03, determine estimates for unknown parameters in the model.\n",
    "2. Scope, Construct, then Evaluate a physics-based differential equation model for the Romi's **turning** behavior. Consider the motor voltage (applied in opposite directions) $V_{turn}$ to be your input, and the Romi's [Yaw Rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaw_(rotation) to be your model's output. \n",
    "3. Determine any unknown parameters in this model using a dataset you collect from a real Romi. You may need to use the Romi's gyroscope (see the [documentation](https://pololu.github.io/romi-32u4-arduino-library/) for the Romi arduino library for help) to measure yaw rate."

    "In section 2, you should formally scope a model for Romi yaw rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "In section 3, you should take the reader through the **major** model construction steps (you do not need to include all of your algebraic manipulations, but you should include an equivalent circuit, element, node, and loop equations you use) and present a final symbolic differential equation. You should also show your work to develop estimates of unknown parameters using a dataset you collect from the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In section 4, you should evaluate your model's external validity by collecting a new yaw rate dataset from the Romi and showing that the model accurately predicts the Romi's motion. You should also collect a new forward velocity dataset from the Romi to test external validity of that model. Briefly comment on the agreement.\n",

    "This is **not** a process writing assignment, so you will only be graded on content and correctness. Typeset any equations you use, and create any explanatory graphics, tables, and/or plots that you develop as you work. You should be showing your model scoping, construction, and evaluations steps in this document. It's an opportunity to practice typesetting equations and making professional-looking figures, which will help prepare you for your project in ES302."
