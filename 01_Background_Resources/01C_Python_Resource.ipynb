Its inputs will often be physical properties of the system (think mass, capacitance, spring constant, etc) and perhaps information about how *long* the simulation should run for.\n",

You can use a **flow chart** to help you break down the tasks your program should perform into steps that can be turned into a line or a few lines of code. This will help you **plan** your program and avoid a situation where you're not sure what line of code you should be writing next!\n",

A basic tutorial on how to use www.diagrams.net to create flow charts is [here](https://www.diagrams.net/doc/getting-started-basic-flow-chart). you can use the snipping tool to turn in a picture of your program's flow chart as part of your assignments in this course!"

    "In Python, the \"standard library\" includes many useful functions and operations. However, we will often need to use *libraries*, which provide additional functionality, to expand Python's capability. The most common of the libraries we'll use is called \"numpy,\" which provides numerical computing functionality similar to MATLAB. To load a library, we have several options, but all of them involve the \"import\" command.\n",
